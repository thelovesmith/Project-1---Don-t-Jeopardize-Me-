### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

The above key will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!


## Project Workflow - 3

Excellent work with your project workflow Avery! Your README was very detailed and provided a ton of narrative to your game. Thank you for editing as your project evolved as well. Also, excellent work with the wireframe! I really appreciate your efforts made here.

## Technical Requirements - 2.5

Congratulations on meeting most of the technical requirements here Avery! Your project was very complex and very well thought out. I know you originally wanted to make it a two player game and also have a game timer run, but had to pivot and make some last minute changes toward the end. Nonetheless, you still finished strong! 

## Creativity - 3

You had one of the most creative projects in class Avery! Congratulations! You have a very good sense of design, which is an excellent quality for front-end development and user experience.

## Code Quality - 2
Your code quality looked great Avery, and has evolved significantly over the last month. As a suggestion, I would recommend the following:
- As a good practice, you should always remove any commented out / non-functioning code and console logs from your master branch. Your html, css, and js files all had instances of this in them. (This was brought up at the end of day after project presentations)
- Be sure to add .DS_Store to your .gitignore file so these kinds of files don’t get pushed to your repo.
- It’s a good industry practice to name your directories with all lowercase characters, this keeps your relative file paths cleaner and easier to parse through when apps become for complex.



## Deployment - 3

Your application was successfully deployed Avery! Excellent work! Also, thank you for providing a link to your deployed project on your github. This makes it much easier for us to see your project live!

## Total 13.5/15

I’m very proud of what you’ve been able to accomplish in such a relatively short amount of time Avery! I’m looking forward to seeing what you’ll create for your next project! In the meantime, keep up the momentum!
